    abstract = {The DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (http://legacysurvey.org/) are a combination of three public projects (the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey, the Beijing–Arizona Sky Survey, and the Mayall z-band Legacy Survey) that will jointly image ≈14,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky visible from the northern hemisphere in three optical bands (g, r, and z) using telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The combined survey footprint is split into two contiguous areas by the Galactic plane. The optical imaging is conducted using a unique strategy of dynamically adjusting the exposure times and pointing selection during observing that results in a survey of nearly uniform depth. In addition to calibrated images, the project is delivering a catalog, constructed by using a probabilistic inference-based approach to estimate source shapes and brightnesses. The catalog includes photometry from the grz optical bands and from four mid-infrared bands (at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 μm) observed by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer satellite during its full operational lifetime. The project plans two public data releases each year. All the software used to generate the catalogs is also released with the data. This paper provides an overview of the Legacy Surveys project.},

    abstract   = {Separating resolved and unresolved sources in large imaging surveys is a fundamental step to enable downstream science, such as searching for extragalactic transients in wide-field time-domain surveys. Here we present our method to effectively separate point sources from the resolved, extended sources in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Surveys (LS). We develop a supervised machine-learning model based on the Gradient Boosting algorithm {\textbackslash}texttt\{XGBoost\}. The features input to the model are purely morphological and are derived from the tabulated LS data products. We train the model using \${\textbackslash}sim\$\$2{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}5\$ LS sources in the COSMOS field with HST morphological labels and evaluate the model performance on LS sources with spectroscopic classification from the DESI Data Release 1 (\${\textbackslash}sim\$\$2{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}7\$ objects) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 (\${\textbackslash}sim\$\$3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}6\$ objects), as well as on \${\textbackslash}sim\$\$2{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}8\$ Gaia stars. A significant fraction of LS sources are not observed in every LS filter, and we therefore build a ``Hybrid'' model as a linear combination of two {\textbackslash}texttt\{XGBoost\} models, each containing features combining aperture flux measurements from the ``blue'' (\$gr\$) and ``red'' (\$iz\$) filters. The Hybrid model shows a reasonable balance between sensitivity and robustness, and achieves higher accuracy and flexibility compared to the LS morphological typing. With the Hybrid model, we provide classification scores for \${\textbackslash}sim\$\$3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}9\$ LS sources, making this the largest ever machine-learning catalog separating resolved and unresolved sources. The catalog has been incorporated into the real-time pipeline of the La Silla Schmidt Southern Survey (LS4), enabling the identification of extragalactic transients within the LS4 alert stream.},

    abstract  = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We present the third data release of the European Space Agency’s {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} mission, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3. This release includes a large variety of new data products, notably a much expanded radial velocity survey and a very extensive astrophysical characterisation of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} sources.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We outline the content and the properties of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3, providing an overview of the main improvements in the data processing in comparison with previous data releases (where applicable) and a brief discussion of the limitations of the data in this release.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 catalogue is the outcome of the processing of raw data collected with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} instruments during the first 34 months of the mission by the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 catalogue contains the same source list, celestial positions, proper motions, parallaxes, and broad band photometry in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} pass-bands already present in the Early Third Data Release, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} EDR3. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 introduces an impressive wealth of new data products. More than 33 million objects in the ranges {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RVS{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 14 and 3100 {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 14 500, have new determinations of their mean radial velocities based on data collected by {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. We provide {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RVS{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} magnitudes for most sources with radial velocities, and a line broadening parameter is listed for a subset of these. Mean {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} spectra are made available to the community. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 catalogue includes about 1 million mean spectra from the radial velocity spectrometer, and about 220 million low-resolution blue and red prism photometer BP/RP mean spectra. The results of the analysis of epoch photometry are provided for some 10 million sources across 24 variability types. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 includes astrophysical parameters and source class probabilities for about 470 million and 1500 million sources, respectively, including stars, galaxies, and quasars. Orbital elements and trend parameters are provided for some 800 000 astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries. More than 150 000 Solar System objects, including new discoveries, with preliminary orbital solutions and individual epoch observations are part of this release. Reflectance spectra derived from the epoch BP/RP spectral data are published for about 60 000 asteroids. Finally, an additional data set is provided, namely the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Andromeda Photometric Survey, consisting of the photometric time series for all sources located in a 5.5 degree radius field centred on the Andromeda galaxy.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} This data release represents a major advance with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} EDR3 because of the unprecedented quantity, quality, and variety of source astrophysical data. To date this is the largest collection of all-sky spectrophotometry, radial velocities, variables, and astrophysical parameters derived from both low- and high-resolution spectra and includes a spectrophotometric and dynamical survey of SSOs of the highest accuracy. The non-single star content surpasses the existing data by orders of magnitude. The quasar host and galaxy light profile collection is the first such survey that is all sky and space based. The astrophysical information provided in {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 will unleash the full potential of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}’s exquisite astrometric, photometric, and radial velocity surveys.},

    abstract = {Image subtraction is essential for transient detection in time-domain astronomy. The point-spread function (PSF), photometric scaling, and sky background generally vary with time and across the field of view for imaging data taken with ground-based optical telescopes. Image subtraction algorithms need to match these variations for the detection of flux variability. An algorithm that can be fully parallelized is highly desirable for future time-domain surveys. Here we introduce the saccadic fast Fourier transform (SFFT) algorithm we developed for image differencing. SFFT uses a δ-function basis for kernel decomposition, and the image subtraction is performed in Fourier space. This brings about a remarkable improvement in computational performance of about an order of magnitude compared to other published image subtraction codes. SFFT can accommodate the spatial variations in wide-field imaging data, including PSF, photometric scaling, and sky background. However, the flexibility of the δ-function basis may also make it more prone to overfitting. The algorithm has been tested extensively on real astronomical data taken by a variety of telescopes. Moreover, the SFFT code allows for the spatial variations of the PSF and sky background to be fitted by spline functions.},

    abstract  = {The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer-scale   high-energy neutrino detector built into the ice at the South Pole.   Construction of IceCube, the largest neutrino detector built to date, was   completed in 2011 and enabled the discovery of high-energy   astrophysical neutrinos.  We describe here the design, production, and   calibration of the IceCube digital optical module (DOM), the cable   systems, computing hardware, and our methodology for   drilling and deployment. We also describe the online triggering and   data filtering systems that select candidate neutrino and cosmic ray   events for analysis. Due to a rigorous pre-deployment protocol, 98.4\% of   the DOMs in the deep ice are operating and collecting data. IceCube routinely   achieves a detector uptime of 99% by emphasizing software stability and   monitoring.  Detector operations have been stable since   construction was completed, and the detector is expected to operate at   least until the end of the next decade.}

The network consists of 21 telescopes with both photometric and spectroscopic facilities. They are connected together thanks to a dedicated infrastructure. The network aims at coordinating the observations of large sky position estimates of transient events to enhance their follow-up and reduce the delay between the initial detection and optical confirmation. The GRANDMA programme mainly focuses on follow-up of gravitational-wave alerts to find and characterize the electromagnetic counterpart during the third observational campaign of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. But it allows for follow-up of any transient alerts involving neutrinos or gamma-ray bursts, even those with poor spatial localization. We present the different facilities, tools, and methods we developed for this network and show its efficiency using observations of LIGO/Virgo S190425z, a binary neutron star merger candidate. We furthermore report on all GRANDMA follow-up observations performed during the first six months of the LIGO–Virgo observational campaign, and we derive constraints on the kilonova properties assuming that the events’ locations were imaged by our telescopes.}},

    abstract = {{GRANDMA (Global Rapid Advanced Network Devoted to the Multi-messenger Addicts) is a network of 25 telescopes of different sizes, including both photometric and spectroscopic facilities. The network aims to coordinate follow-up observations of gravitational-wave (GW) candidate alerts, especially those with large localization uncertainties, to reduce the delay between the initial detection and the optical confirmation. In this paper, we detail GRANDMA’s observational performance during Advanced LIGO/Advanced Virgo Observing Run 3 (O3), focusing on the second part of O3; this includes summary statistics pertaining to coverage and possible astrophysical origin of the candidates. To do so, we quantify our observation efficiency in terms of delay between GW candidate trigger time, observations, and the total coverage. Using an optimized and robust coordination system, GRANDMA followed-up about 90 per cent of the GW candidate alerts, that is 49 out of 56 candidates. This led to coverage of over 9000 deg2 during O3. The delay between the GW candidate trigger and the first observation was below 1.5 h for 50 per cent of the alerts. We did not detect any electromagnetic counterparts to the GW candidates during O3, likely due to the very large localization areas (on average thousands of degrees squares) and relatively large distance of the candidates (above 200 Mpc for 60 per cent of binary neutron star, BNS candidates). We derive constraints on potential kilonova properties for two potential BNS coalescences (GW190425 and S200213t), assuming that the events’ locations were imaged.}},

We use the Galaxy List for the Advanced Detector Era (GLADE) galaxy catalog, which we show is complete (with respect to a Schechter function) out to ∼300 Mpc for galaxies brighter than the median Schechter function galaxy luminosity. We use a prioritization algorithm to select the galaxies with the highest chance of containing the counterpart given their luminosity, their position, and their distance relative to a GW localization, and in which we are most likely to detect a counterpart given its expected brightness compared to the limiting magnitude of our telescopes. This algorithm can be easily adapted to any expected transient parameters and telescopes. We implemented this strategy during the second Advanced Detector Observing Run (O2) and followed the black hole merger GW170814 and the neutron star merger GW170817. For the latter, we identified an optical kilonova/macronova counterpart thanks to our algorithm selecting the correct host galaxy fifth in its ranked list among the 182 galaxies we identified in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)/Virgo localization. This also allowed us to obtain some of the earliest observations of the first optical transient ever triggered by a GW detection (as presented in a companion paper).}

    abstract  = {Compact binary system mergers are expected to generate gravitational radiation detectable by ground-based interferometers. A subset of these, the merger of a neutron star with another neutron star or a black hole, are also the most popular model for the production of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) trigger on short GRBs (SGRBs) at rates that reflect their relative sky exposures, with the BAT detecting 10 per year compared to about 45 for GBM. We examine the SGRB populations detected by Swift BAT and Fermi GBM. We find that the Swift BAT triggers on weaker SGRBs than Fermi GBM, providing they occur close to the center of the BAT field of view, and that the Fermi GBM SGRB detection threshold remains flatter across its field of view. Overall, these effects combine to give the instruments the same average sensitivity, and account for the SGRBs that trigger one instrument but not the other. We do not find any evidence that the BAT and GBM are detecting significantly different populations of SGRBs. Both instruments can detect untriggered SGRBs using ground searches seeded with time and position. The detection of SGRBs below the on-board triggering sensitivities of Swift BAT and Fermi GBM increases the possibility of detecting and localizing the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave (GW) events seen by the new generation of GW detectors.}

    abstract = {Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are among the most luminous explosions in the universe and their origin still remains uncertain. Observational evidence favors the association with binary neutron star or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) binary mergers. Leading models relate SGRBs to a relativistic jet launched by the BH-torus system resulting from the merger. However, recent observations have revealed a large fraction of SGRB events accompanied by X-ray afterglows with durations ~10 2 -10 5 s, suggesting continuous energy injection from a long-lived central engine, which is incompatible with the short ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 1 s) accretion timescale of a BH-torus system. The formation of a supramassive NS, resisting the collapse on much longer spin-down timescales, can explain these afterglow durations, but leaves serious doubts on whether a relativistic jet can be launched at the merger. Here we present a novel scenario accommodating both aspects, where the SGRB is produced after the collapse of a supramassive NS. Early differential rotation and subsequent spin-down emission generate an optically thick environment around the NS consisting of a photon-pair nebula and an outer shell of baryon-loaded ejecta. While the jet easily drills through this environment, spin-down radiation diffuses outward on much longer timescales and accumulates a delay that allows the SGRB to be observed before (part of) the long-lasting X-ray signal. By analyzing diffusion timescales for a wide range of physical parameters, we find delays that can generally reach ~10 5 s, compatible with observations. The success of this fundamental test makes this "time-reversal" scenario an attractive alternative to current SGRB models.}

    abstract = {{The ever-increasing sensitivity of the network of gravitational-wave detectors has resulted in the accelerated rate of detections from compact binary coalescence systems in the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. Not only has the event rate increased, but also the distances to which phenomena can be detected, leading to a rise in the required sky volume coverage to search for counterparts. Additionally, the improvement of the detectors has resulted in the discovery of more compact binary mergers involving neutron stars, revitalizing dedicated follow-up campaigns. While significant effort has been made by the community to optimize single telescope observations, using both synoptic and galaxy-targeting methods, less effort has been paid to coordinated observations in a network. This is becoming crucial, as the advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has garnered interest around the globe, resulting in abundant networks of telescopes available to search for counterparts. In this paper, we extend some of the techniques developed for single telescopes to a telescope network. We describe simple modifications to these algorithms and demonstrate them on existing network examples. These algorithms are implemented in the open-source software gwemopt, used by some follow-up teams, for ease of use by the broader community.}},

The EMCCD enables single-band optical imaging in the Sloan g and r bands and Johnson UVRI filters. The EMCCD is chosen for its sub-electron effective read noise using large multiplicative gains. With these systems, frame rates of greater than 1 Hz are possible. The field of view is 4.4 × 4.4 arcmin2 and the pixel size is 0.259 arcsec. This camera, coupled with a fully roboticized telescope, is ideal for follow-up of short period, white dwarf binary candidates, as well as short duration transient and periodic sources identified by large field-of-view all-sky surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility.}},

Between the plethora of modelling and observations, the rich synergy that exists among the available data sets creates a unique opportunity to constrain the binary parameters, the equation of state of supranuclear density matter, and the physical processes at work during the kilonova and gamma-ray burst. We report, for the first time, Bayesian parameter estimation combining information from GW170817, AT2017gfo, and GRB170817 to obtain truly multimessenger constraints on the tidal deformability \\$\\tilde\\{\\Lambda \\} \\in [302,860]\\$, total binary mass M ∈ [2.722, 2.751] M⊙, the radius of a 1.4 solar mass neutron star \\$R \\in [11.3,13.5] \\,\\,\\rm km\\$ (with additional \\$0.2\\ \\rm km\\$ systematic uncertainty), and an upper bound on the mass ratio of q ≤ 1.27, all at 90 per cent confidence. Our joint novel analysis uses new phenomenological descriptions of the dynamical ejecta, debris disc mass, and remnant black hole properties, all derived from a large suite of numerical relativity simulations.}},

    abstract = {{GW170817 showed that neutron star mergers not only emit gravitational waves but also can release electromagnetic signatures in multiple wavelengths. Within the first half of the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, there have been a number of gravitational wave candidates of compact binary systems for which at least one component is potentially a neutron star. In this article, we look at the candidates S190425z, S190426c, S190510g, S190901ap, and S190910h, predicted to have potentially a non-zero remnant mass, in more detail. All these triggers have been followed up with extensive campaigns by the astronomical community doing electromagnetic searches for their optical counterparts; however, according to the released classification, there is a high probability that some of these events might not be of extraterrestrial origin. Assuming that the triggers are caused by a compact binary coalescence and that the individual source locations have been covered during the EM follow-up campaigns, we employ three different kilonova models and apply them to derive possible constraints on the matter ejection consistent with the publicly available gravitational-wave trigger information and the lack of a kilonova detection. These upper bounds on the ejecta mass can be related to limits on the maximum mass of the binary neutron star candidate S190425z and to constraints on the mass-ratio, spin, and NS compactness for the potential black hole–neutron star candidate S190426c. Our results show that deeper electromagnetic observations for future gravitational wave events near the horizon limit of the advanced detectors are essential.}},

The EMCCD enables single-band optical imaging in the Sloan g and r bands and Johnson UVRI filters. The EMCCD is chosen for its sub-electron effective read noise using large multiplicative gains. With these systems, frame rates of greater than 1 Hz are possible. The field of view is 4.4 × 4.4 arcmin2 and the pixel size is 0.259 arcsec. This camera, coupled with a fully roboticized telescope, is ideal for follow-up of short period, white dwarf binary candidates, as well as short duration transient and periodic sources identified by large field-of-view all-sky surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility.}},

It incorporates new telescope aspheric corrector optics, dome and telescope drives, a large-format exposure shutter, a flat-field illumination system, a robotic bandpass filter exchanger, and the key element: a new 47-square-degree, 600Â megapixel cryogenic CCD mosaic science camera, along with supporting equipment. The OS collects and delivers digitized survey data to the ZTF Data System (DS). Here, we describe the ZTF OS design, optical implementation, delivered image quality, detector performance, and robotic survey efficiency.}

The high level of accuracy and of stability of our relativistic multidomain pseudo-spectral code enables us to explore the whole solution space for broad ranges of the degree of differential rotation, but also of the stellar density and oblateness. Staying within an astrophysically motivated range of rotation profiles, we investigate the characteristics of neutron stars with maximal mass for all types of families of differentially rotating relativistic objects identified in a previous article. We find that the maximum mass depends on both the degree of differential rotation and the type of solution. It turns out that the maximum allowed mass can be up to 4 times higher than what it is for nonrotating stars with the same equation of state. Such values are obtained for a modest degree of differential rotation but for one of the newly discovered types of solutions. Since such configurations of stars are not that extreme, this result may have important consequences for the gravitational wave signal expected from coalescing neutron star binaries or from some supernova events.}

Approximately 1.7Â s prior to this GRB, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory triggered on a binary compact merger candidate associated with the GRB. This is the first unambiguous coincident observation of gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation from a single astrophysical source and marks the start of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy. We report the GBM observations and analysis of this ordinary short GRB, which extraordinarily confirms that at least some short GRBs are produced by binary compact mergers.}

    abstract = {Gravity gradients are an effective method for delineating the extent of subsurface density anomalies. The change in subsurface density contrasts due to the seismic deformation gives rise to detectable gravity changes via the dilatational gravity signal or Bouguer anomaly. Solutions for the corresponding gravity gradients of these signals are developed for a vertical strike-slip fault. Gravity gradient solutions exhibit similar spatial distributions as those calculated for Coulomb stress changes, reflecting their physical relationship to the stress changes. The signals' magnitudes, of the order of 10-4 E, are beyond the resolution of typical exploration instruments. Improvements to Superconducting Gravity Gradiometers are necessary for gravity gradients to be used as a viable method for the observation of the stress field changes over large spatial scales.},

    abstract  = {The intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) autonomously responded to and promptly tiled the error region of the first gravitational-wave event GW150914 to search for an optical counterpart. Only a small fraction of the total localized region was immediately visible in the northern night sky, due both to Sun-angle and elevation constraints. Here, we report on the transient candidates identified and rapid follow-up undertaken to determine the nature of each candidate. Even in the small area imaged of 126 deg2, after extensive filtering, eight candidates were deemed worthy of additional follow-up. Within two hours, all eight were spectroscopically classified by the Keck II telescope. Curiously, even though such events are rare, one of our candidates was a superluminous supernova. We obtained radio data with the Jansky Very Large Array and X-ray follow-up with the Swift satellite for this transient. None of our candidates appear to be associated with the gravitational-wave trigger, which is unsurprising given that GW150914 came from the merger of two stellar-mass black holes. This end-to-end discovery and follow-up campaign bodes well for future searches in this post-detection era of gravitational waves.}

At 4.5μm, GW170817 is detected at 21.9 mag AB at +43 days and 23.9 mag AB at +74 days after merger. At 3.6μm, GW170817 is not detected to a limit of 23.2 mag AB at +43 days and 23.1 mag AB at +74 days. Our detections constitute the latest and reddest constraints on the kilonova/macronova emission and composition of heavy elements. The 4.5μm luminosity at this late phase cannot be explained by elements exclusively from the first abundance peak of the r-process. Moreover, the steep decline in the Spitzer band, with a power-law index of 3.4 ± 0.2, can be explained by a few of the heaviest isotopes with half-life around 14 days dominating the luminosity (e.g. 140Ba, 143Pr, 147Nd, 156Eu, 191Os, 223Ra, 225Ra, 233Pa, 234Th) or a model with lower deposition efficiency. This data offers evidence that the heaviest elements in the second and third r-process abundance peak were indeed synthesized. Our conclusion is verified by both analytics and network simulations and robust despite intricacies and uncertainties in the nuclear physics. Future observations with Spitzer and James Webb Space Telescope will further illuminate the relative abundance of the synthesized heavy elements.}},

    abstract = {We present the first simulation addressing the prospects of finding an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to gravitational wave (GW) detections during the early years of only two advanced detectors. The perils of such a search may have appeared insurmountable when considering the coarse ring-shaped GW localizations spanning thousands of square degrees using time-of-arrival information alone. Leveraging the amplitude and phase information of the predicted GW signal narrows the localization to arcs with a median area of only a few hundred square degrees, thereby making an EM search tractable. Based on the locations and orientations of the two LIGO detectors, we find that the GW sensitivity is limited to only two of the four sky quadrants. Thus, the rates of GW events with two interferometers is only ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 40% of the rate with three interferometers of similar sensitivity. Another important implication of the sky quadrant bias is that EM observatories in North America and Southern Africa would be able to systematically respond to GW triggers several hours sooner than Russia and Chile. Given the larger sky areas and the relative proximity of detected mergers, 1 m class telescopes with very wide-field cameras are well-positioned for the challenge of finding an EM counterpart. Identification of the EM counterpart amidst the larger numbers of false positives further underscores the importance of building a comprehensive catalog of foreground stellar sources, background active galactic nucleus and potential host galaxies in the local universe. This initial study is based on a small sample of 17 detected mergers; future works will expand this sample.}

    abstract = {We present the results of numerical simulations of the prompt emission of short-duration gamma-ray bursts. We consider emission from the relativistic jet, the mildly relativistic cocoon, and the non-relativistic shocked ambient material. We find that the cocoon material is confined between off-axis angles ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/1/L6/apjlaa8f3dieqn1.gif] {$15\lesssim \theta \lesssim 45^\circ $} and gives origin to X-ray transients with a duration of a few to ∼10 s, delayed by a few seconds from the time of the merger. We also discuss the distance at which such transients can be detected, finding that it depends sensitively on the assumptions that are made about the radiation spectrum. Purely thermal cocoon transients are detectable only out to a few Mpc, while Comptonized transients can instead be detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) out to several tens of Mpc.}

    abstract = {The fundamental strong interaction determines the nature of pulsar-like compact stars which are essentially in the form of bulk strong matter. From an observational point of view, it is proposed that bulk strong matter could be composed of strangeons, i.e. quark-clusters with three-light-flavor symmetry of quarks, and therefore pulsar-like compact objects could actually be strangeon stars. The equation of state (EOS) of strangeon stars is described in a Lennard-Jones model for the purpose of constraining the EOS by both the tidal deformability {\$}{\backslash}Lambda{\$}$\Lambda$of GW 170817 and {\$}M{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}TOV{\}}{\}}{\$}MTOV . It is found that the allowed parameter space is quite large as most of the Lennard-Jones EOS models satisfy the tidal deformability constraint by GW 170817. The future GW detections for smaller values of {\$}{\backslash}Lambda{\$}$\Lambda$and mass measurement for larger values of {\$}M{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}TOV{\}}{\}}{\$}MTOV will help find a better constraint on the strangeon star model.},

    abstract = {We consider the long-term evolution of debris following the tidal disruption of compact stars in the context of short gamma ray bursts. The initial encounter impulsively creates a hot, dense, neutrino-cooled disk capable of powering the prompt emission. After a long delay, we find that powerful winds are launched from the surface of the disk, driven by the recombination of free nucleons into ??-particles. The associated energy release depletes the mass supply and eventually shuts off activity of the central engine. As a result, the luminosity and mass accretion rate deviate from the earlier self-similar behavior expected for an isolated ring with efficient cooling. This then enables a secondary episode of delayed activity to become prominent as an observable signature, when material in the tidal tails produced by the initial encounter returns to the vicinity of the central object. The timescale of the new accretion event can reach tens of seconds to minutes, depending on the details of the system. The associated energies and timescales are consistent with those occurring in X-ray flares.}

    abstract  = {The Zwicky Transient Facility is a large optical survey in multiple filters producing hundreds of thousands of transient alerts per night. We describe here various machine learning (ML) implementations and plans to make the maximal use of the large data set by taking advantage of the temporal nature of the data, and further combining it with other data sets. We start with the initial steps of separating bogus candidates from real ones, separating stars and galaxies, and go on to the classification of real objects into various classes. Besides the usual methods (e.g., based on features extracted from light curves) we also describe early plans for alternate methods including the use of domain adaptation, and deep learning. In a similar fashion we describe efforts to detect fast moving asteroids. We also describe the use of the Zooniverse platform for helping with classifications through the creation of training samples, and active learning. Finally we mention the synergistic aspects of ZTF and LSST from the ML perspective.}

    abstract      = {The binary neutron-star merger GW1708171 was accompanied by radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum2 and localized2 to the galaxy NGC 4993 at a distance3 of about 41 megaparsecs from Earth. The radio and X-ray afterglows of GW170817 exhibited delayed onset4--7, a gradual increase8 in the emission with time (proportional to t0.8) to a peak about 150 days after the merger event9, followed by a relatively rapid decline9,10. So far, various models have been proposed to explain the afterglow emission, including a choked-jet cocoon4,8,11--13 and a successful-jet cocoon4,8,11--18 (also called a structured jet). However, the observational data have remained inconclusive10,15,19,20 as to whether GW170817 launched a successful relativistic jet. Here we report radio observations using very long-baseline interferometry. We find that the compact radio source associated with GW170817 exhibits superluminal apparent motion between 75 days and 230 days after the merger event. This measurement breaks the degeneracy between the choked- and successful-jet cocoon models and indicates that, although the early-time radio emission was powered by a wide-angle outflow8 (a cocoon), the late-time emission was most probably dominated by an energetic and narrowly collimated jet (with an opening angle of less than five degrees) and observed from a viewing angle of about 20 degrees. The imaging of a collimated relativistic outflow emerging from GW170817 adds substantial weight to the evidence linking binary neutron-star mergers and short γ-ray bursts.},

The collimation mechanism of the jet is a longstanding theoretical problem. We numerically analyze the jet propagation in the material ejected by a double neutron star (NS) merger, and demonstrate that if the ejecta mass is ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 10 –2 M ☉ , the jet is well confined by the cocoon and emerges from the ejecta with the required collimation angle. Our results also suggest that there are some populations of choked (failed) SGRBs or new types of events with low luminosity. By constructing a model for SGRB 130603B, which is associated with the first kilonova/macronova candidate, we infer that the equation of state of NSs would be soft enough to provide sufficient ejecta to collimate the jet, if this event is associated with a double NS merger.}

Our aim is to provide usable analytical expressions of the diffracted field with respect to the variation of propagation and diffraction parameters. Particular attention is paid to the determination of a trade-off between computing accuracy and simplicity. An illustration of the use of the various expressions describing the beam diffraction and propagation is given for the case of mode coupling in a single-mode fiber.}

The significance of association between the gamma-ray burst observed by INTEGRAL and GW170817 is 3.2Ï, while the association between the Fermi-GBM and INTEGRAL detections is 4.2Ï. GRB 170817A was detected by the SPI-ACS instrument about 2 s after the end of the GW event. We measure a fluence of (1.4Â Â±Â 0.4Â Â±Â 0.6)Â ÃÂ 10â7 erg cmâ2 (75â2000 keV), where, respectively, the statistical error is given at the 1Ï confidence level, and the systematic error corresponds to the uncertainty in the spectral model and instrument response. We also report on the pointed follow-up observations carried out by INTEGRAL, starting 19.5 hr after the event, and lasting for 5.4 days. We provide a stringent upper limit on any electromagnetic signal in a very broad energy range, from 3 keV to 8 MeV, constraining the soft gamma-ray afterglow flux to <7.1Â ÃÂ 10â11 erg cmâ2Â sâ1 (80â300 keV). Exploiting the unique capabilities of INTEGRAL, we constrained the gamma-ray line emission from radioactive decays that are expected to be the principal source of the energy behind a kilonova event following a BNS coalescence. Finally, we put a stringent upper limit on any delayed bursting activity, for example, from a newly formed magnetar.}

    abstract = {Besides being among the most promising sources of gravitational waves, merging neutron star binaries also represent a leading scenario to explain the phenomenology of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). Recent observations have revealed a large subclass of SGRBs with roughly constant luminosity in their X-ray afterglows, lasting 10-10 4 s. These features are generally taken as evidence of a long-lived central engine powered by the magnetic spin-down of a uniformly rotating, magnetized object. We propose a different scenario in which the central engine powering the X-ray emission is a differentially rotating hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) that launches a quasi-isotropic and baryon-loaded wind driven by the magnetic field, which is built-up through differential rotation. Our model is supported by long-term, three-dimensional, general-relativistic, and ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations, showing that this isotropic emission is a very robust feature. For a given HMNS, the presence of a collimated component depends sensitively on the initial magnetic field geometry, while the stationary electromagnetic luminosity depends only on the magnetic energy initially stored in the system. We show that our model is compatible with the observed timescales and luminosities and express the latter in terms of a simple scaling relation.}

    abstract  = {In the era of large photometric surveys, the importance of automated and accurate classification is rapidly increasing. Specifically, the separation of resolved and unresolved sources in astronomical imaging is a critical initial step for a wide array of studies, ranging from Galactic science to large scale structure and cosmology. Here, we present our method to construct a large, deep catalog of point sources utilizing Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) 3Ï survey data, which consists of âŒ3Â ÃÂ 109 sources with mÂ â²Â 23.5 mag. We develop a supervised machine-learning methodology, using the random forest (RF) algorithm, to construct the PS1 morphology model. We train the model using âŒ5Â ÃÂ 104 PS1 sources with HST COSMOS morphological classifications and assess its performance using âŒ4Â ÃÂ 106 sources with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra and âŒ2Â ÃÂ 108 Gaia sources. We construct 11 âwhite fluxâ features, which combine PS1 flux and shape measurements across five filters, to increase the signal-to-noise ratio relative to any individual filter. The RF model is compared to three alternative models, including the SDSS and PS1 photometric classification models, and we find that the RF model performs best. By number the PS1 catalog is dominated by faint sources (mÂ â³Â 21 mag), and in this regime the RF model significantly outperforms the SDSS and PS1 models. For time-domain surveys, identifying unresolved sources is crucial for inferring the Galactic or extragalactic origin of new transients. We have classified âŒ1.5Â ÃÂ 109 sources using the RF model, and these results are used within the Zwicky Transient Facility real-time pipeline to automatically reject stellar sources from the extragalactic alert stream.}

    abstract = {We study the role of light, neutron-rich nuclei during r -process nucleosynthesis in supernovae. Most previous studies of the r -process have concentrated on the reaction flow of heavy, unstable nuclei. Although the nuclear reaction network includes a few thousand heavy nuclei, only limited reaction flow through light nuclei near the stability line has been used in those studies. However, in a viable scenario of the r -process in neutrino-driven winds, the initial condition is a high-entropy hot plasma consisting of neutrons, protons, and electron-positron pairs experiencing an intense flux of neutrinos. In such environments, light nuclei, as well as heavy nuclei, are expected to play important roles in the production of seed nuclei and r -process elements. Thus, we have extended our fully implicit nuclear reaction network so that it includes all nuclei up to the neutron-drip line for Z ??? 10, in addition to a larger network for Z ??? 10. In the present nucleosynthesis study, we utilize a wind model of massive Type II supernova explosions to study the effects of this extended network. We find that a new nuclear reaction flow path opens in the very light, neutron-rich region. This new nuclear reaction flow can change the final heavy-element abundances by as much as an order of magnitude.}

These afterglow observations have uncovered 71 X-ray detections, 30 optical/NIR detections, and 4 radio detections. Employing the standard afterglow synchrotron model, we perform joint probability analyses for a subset of 38 short GRBs with well-sampled light curves to infer the burst isotropic-equivalent energies and circumburst densities. For this subset, we find median isotropic-equivalent γ -ray and kinetic energies of E γ ,iso≈2×10 51 erg, and E K ,iso ≈(1–3)×10 51 erg, respectively, depending on the values of the model input parameters. We further find that short GRBs occur in low-density environments, with a median density of n ≈(3–15)×10 −3 cm −3 , and that ≈80%–95% of bursts have densities of n≲1 cm −3 . We investigate trends between the circumburst densities and host galaxy properties, and find that events located at large projected offsets of ≳10 effective radii from their hosts exhibit particularly low densities of n≲10 −4 cm −3 , consistent with an intergalactic medium-like environment. Using late-time afterglow data for 11 events, we find a median jet opening angle of θ j=16±10°. We also calculate a median beaming factor of f b≈0.04, leading to a beaming-corrected total energy release of E true≈1.6×10 50 erg. Furthermore, we calculate a beaming-corrected event rate of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/815/2/102/apj521675ieqn1.gif] {${{\mathfrak{R}}}_{{\rm{true}}}={270}_{-180}^{+1580}$} Gpc −3 yr −1 , or ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/815/2/102/apj521675ieqn2.gif] {$\approx {8}_{-5}^{+47}$} yr −1 within a 200 Mpc volume, the Advanced LIGO/Virgo typical detection distance for NS–NS binaries.}

The discovery rate is expected to increase in the future as soon as new surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Large Synoptic Sky Survey (LSST) come online. Presently, the rate at which transients are classified is approximately one order or magnitude lower than the discovery rate, leading to an increasing “follow-up drought”. Existing telescopes with moderate aperture can help address this deficit when equipped with spectrographs optimized for spectral classification. Here, we provide an overview of the design, operations and first results of the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM), operating on the Palomar 60-inch telescope (P60). The instrument is optimized for classification and high observing efficiency. It combines a low-resolution (R∼100) integral field unit (IFU) spectrograph with “Rainbow Camera” (RC), a multi-band field acquisition camera which also serves as multi-band ( ugri ) photometer. The SEDM was commissioned during the operation of the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) and has already lived up to its promise. The success of the SEDM demonstrates the value of spectrographs optimized for spectral classification.}

    abstract = {Transient detection and flux measurement via image subtraction stand at the base of time domain astronomy. Due to the varying seeing conditions, the image subtraction process is non-trivial, and existing solutions suffer from a variety of problems. Starting from basic statistical principles, we develop the optimal statistic for transient detection, flux measurement, and any image-difference hypothesis testing. We derive a closed-form statistic that: (1) is mathematically proven to be the optimal transient detection statistic in the limit of background-dominated noise, (2) is numerically stable, (3) for accurately registered, adequately sampled images, does not leave subtraction or deconvolution artifacts, (4) allows automatic transient detection to the theoretical sensitivity limit by providing credible detection significance, (5) has uncorrelated white noise, (6) is a sufficient statistic for any further statistical test on the difference image, and, in particular, allows us to distinguish particle hits and other image artifacts from real transients, (7) is symmetric to the exchange of the new and reference images, (8) is at least an order of magnitude faster to compute than some popular methods, and (9) is straightforward to implement. Furthermore, we present extensions of this method that make it resilient to registration errors, color-refraction errors, and any noise source that can be modeled. In addition, we show that the optimal way to prepare a reference image is the proper image coaddition presented in Zackay & Ofek. We demonstrate this method on simulated data and real observations from the PTF data release 2. We provide an implementation of this algorithm in MATLAB and Python.}

We present a simple mid-infrared color criterion, W 1 – W 2 ≥ 0.8 (i.e., [3.4]–[4.6] ≥0.8, Vega), which identifies 61.9 ± 5.4 active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates per deg 2 to a depth of W 2 ~ 15.0. This implies a much larger census of luminous AGNs than found by typical wide-area surveys, attributable to the fact that mid-infrared selection identifies both unobscured (type 1) and obscured (type 2) AGNs. Optical and soft X-ray surveys alone are highly biased toward only unobscured AGNs, while this simple WISE selection likely identifies even heavily obscured, Compton-thick AGNs. Using deep, public data in the COSMOS field, we explore the properties of WISE -selected AGN candidates. At the mid-infrared depth considered, 160 μJy at 4.6 μm, this simple criterion identifies 78% of Spitzer mid-infrared AGN candidates according to the criteria of Stern et al. and the reliability is 95%. We explore the demographics, multiwavelength properties and redshift distribution of WISE -selected AGN candidates in the COSMOS field.}

    abstract = {The all sky surveys done by the Palomar Observatory Schmidt, the European Southern Observatory Schmidt, and the United Kingdom Schmidt, the InfraRed Astronomical Satellite, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey have proven to be extremely useful tools for astronomy with value that lasts for decades. The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is mapping the whole sky following its launch on 2009 December 14. WISE began surveying the sky on 2010 January 14 and completed its first full coverage of the sky on July 17. The survey will continue to cover the sky a second time until the cryogen is exhausted (anticipated in 2010 November). WISE is achieving 5σ point source sensitivities better than 0.08, 0.11, 1, and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in bands centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 μm. Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal background. The angular resolution is 6 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcs.gif] {farcs} 1, 6 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcs.gif] {farcs} 4, 6 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcs.gif] {farcs} 5, and 12 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcs.gif] {farcs} 0 at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 μm, and the astrometric precision for high signal-to-noise sources is better than 0 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcs.gif] {farcs} 15.}

The data used here were primarily taken from the Asiago Supernova Catalogue, but were supplemented with additional data. We accounted for both foreground and host-galaxy extinction. A bootstrap method is used to correct the samples for Malmquist bias. Separately, we generate volume-limited samples, restricted to events within 100 Mpc. We find that the superluminous events (MB
                 < –21) make up only about 0.1% of all SNe in the bias-corrected sample. The subluminous events (MB
                 > –15) make up about 3%. The normal Ia distribution was the brightest with a mean absolute blue magnitude of –19.25. The IIP distribution was the dimmest at –16.75.}

    abstract = {We present an implementation of the Gehrels et al. galaxy-targeted strategy for gravitational-wave (GW) follow-up using the Las Cumbres Observatory global network of telescopes. We use the Galaxy List for the Advanced Detector Era (GLADE) galaxy catalog, which we show is complete (with respect to a Schechter function) out to ∼300 Mpc for galaxies brighter than the median Schechter function galaxy luminosity. We use a prioritization algorithm to select the galaxies with the highest chance of containing the counterpart given their luminosity, their position, and their distance relative to a GW localization, and in which we are most likely to detect a counterpart given its expected brightness compared to the limiting magnitude of our telescopes. This algorithm can be easily adapted to any expected transient parameters and telescopes. We implemented this strategy during the second Advanced Detector Observing Run (O2) and followed the black hole merger GW170814 and the neutron star merger GW170817. For the latter, we identified an optical kilonova/macronova counterpart thanks to our algorithm selecting the correct host galaxy fifth in its ranked list among the 182 galaxies we identified in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)/Virgo localization. This also allowed us to obtain some of the earliest observations of the first optical transient ever triggered by a GW detection (as presented in a companion paper).}

    abstract  = {We report the discovery and multiwavelength data analysis of the peculiar optical transient, ATLAS17aeu. This transient was identified in the sky map of the LIGO gravitational wave event GW 170104 by our ATLAS and Pan-STARRS coverage. ATLAS17aeu was discovered 23.1 hr after GW 170104 and rapidly faded over the next three nights, with a spectrum revealing a blue featureless continuum. The transient was also detected as a fading X-ray source by Swift and in the radio at 6 and 15 GHz. The gamma-ray burst GRB 170105A was detected by three satellites 19.04 hr after GW 170104 and 4.10 hr before our first optical detection. We analyze the multiwavelength fluxes in the context of the known GRB population and discuss the observed sky rates of GRBs and their afterglows. We find it statistically likely that ATLAS17aeu is an afterglow associated with GRB 170105A, with a chance coincidence ruled out at the 99\% confidence or 2.6Ï. A long, soft GRB within a redshift range of  would be consistent with all the observed multiwavelength data. The Poisson probability of a chance occurrence of GW 170104 and ATLAS17aeu is pÂ =Â 0.04. This is the probability of a chance coincidence in 2D sky location and in time. These observations indicate that ATLAS17aeu is plausibly a normal GRB afterglow at significantly higher redshift than the distance constraint for GW 170104 and therefore a chance coincidence. However, if a redshift of the faint host were to place it within the GW 170104 distance range, then physical association with GW 170104 should be considered.}

    abstract = {Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are among the most luminous explosions in the universe and their origin still remains uncertain. Observational evidence favors the association with binary neutron star or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) binary mergers. Leading models relate SGRBs to a relativistic jet launched by the BH-torus system resulting from the merger. However, recent observations have revealed a large fraction of SGRB events accompanied by X-ray afterglows with durations ~10 2 -10 5 s, suggesting continuous energy injection from a long-lived central engine, which is incompatible with the short ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 1 s) accretion timescale of a BH-torus system. The formation of a supramassive NS, resisting the collapse on much longer spin-down timescales, can explain these afterglow durations, but leaves serious doubts on whether a relativistic jet can be launched at the merger. Here we present a novel scenario accommodating both aspects, where the SGRB is produced after the collapse of a supramassive NS. Early differential rotation and subsequent spin-down emission generate an optically thick environment around the NS consisting of a photon-pair nebula and an outer shell of baryon-loaded ejecta. While the jet easily drills through this environment, spin-down radiation diffuses outward on much longer timescales and accumulates a delay that allows the SGRB to be observed before (part of) the long-lasting X-ray signal. By analyzing diffusion timescales for a wide range of physical parameters, we find delays that can generally reach ~10 5 s, compatible with observations. The success of this fundamental test makes this "time-reversal" scenario an attractive alternative to current SGRB models.}

    abstract = {Compact binary coalescences are a promising source of gravitational waves for second-generation interferometric gravitational-wave detectors such as advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo. These are among the most promising sources for joint detection of electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational-wave (GW) emission. To maximize the science performed with these objects, it is essential to undertake a followup observing strategy that maximizes the likelihood of detecting the EM counterpart. We present a follow-up strategy that maximizes the counterpart detection probability, given a fixed investment of telescope time. We show how the prior assumption on the luminosity function of the electro-magnetic counterpart impacts the optimized followup strategy. Our results suggest that if the goal is to detect an EM counterpart from among a succession of GW triggers, the optimal strategy is to perform long integrations in the highest likelihood regions. For certain assumptions about source luminosity and mass distributions, we find that an optimal time investment that is proportional to the 2/3 power of the surface density of the GW location probability on the sky. In the future, this analysis framework will benefit significantly from the 3-dimensional localization probability.},

We use an array of six photodiodes with filters that approximate the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope's u, g, r, i, z, and y bands. We use the sun as a proxy for the moon, and measure sky brightness as a function of zenith angle of the point on sky, zenith angle of the sun, and angular distance between the sun and the point on sky. We make a correction for the difference between the illumination spectrum of the sun and the moon. Since scattered sunlight totally dominates the daytime sky brightness, this technique allows us to cleanly determine the contribution to the (cloudless) night sky from backscattered moonlight, without contamination from other sources of night sky brightness. We estimate our uncertainty in the relative lunar night sky brightness vs. zenith and lunar angle to be between 0.3--0.7 mags depending on the passband. This information is useful in planning the optimal execution of the LSST survey, and perhaps for other astronomical observations as well. Although our primary objective is to map out the angular structure and spectrum of the scattered light from the atmosphere and particulates, we also make an estimate of the expected number of scattered lunar photons per pixel per second in LSST, and find values that are in overall agreement with previous estimates.},

Both being potential hosts of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, GLADE includes inactive and active galaxies as well. GLADE was constructed by cross-matching and combining data from five separate (but not independent) astronomical catalogues: GWGC, 2MPZ, 2MASS XSC, HyperLEDA, and SDSS-DR12Q. GLADE is complete up to \\$d\_\\{\\rm L\\}=37^\\{+3\\}\_\\{-4\\}\\, \\mathrm\\{Mpc\\}\\$ in terms of the cumulative B-band luminosity of galaxies within luminosity distance dL, and contains all of the brightest galaxies giving half of the total B-band luminosity up to \\$d\_\\{\\rm L\\}=91\\, \\mathrm\\{Mpc\\}\\$. As B-band luminosity is expected to be a tracer of binary neutron star mergers (currently the prime targets of joint GW+EM detections), our completeness measures can be used as estimations of completeness for containing all binary neutron star merger hosts in the local Universe.}},

The high level of accuracy and of stability of our relativistic multidomain pseudo-spectral code enables us to explore the whole solution space for broad ranges of the degree of differential rotation, but also of the stellar density and oblateness. Staying within an astrophysically motivated range of rotation profiles, we investigate the characteristics of neutron stars with maximal mass for all types of families of differentially rotating relativistic objects identified in a previous article. We find that the maximum mass depends on both the degree of differential rotation and the type of solution. It turns out that the maximum allowed mass can be up to 4 times higher than what it is for nonrotating stars with the same equation of state. Such values are obtained for a modest degree of differential rotation but for one of the newly discovered types of solutions. Since such configurations of stars are not that extreme, this result may have important consequences for the gravitational wave signal expected from coalescing neutron star binaries or from some supernova events.}

    abstract = {Gravity gradients are an effective method for delineating the extent of subsurface density anomalies. The change in subsurface density contrasts due to the seismic deformation gives rise to detectable gravity changes via the dilatational gravity signal or Bouguer anomaly. Solutions for the corresponding gravity gradients of these signals are developed for a vertical strike-slip fault. Gravity gradient solutions exhibit similar spatial distributions as those calculated for Coulomb stress changes, reflecting their physical relationship to the stress changes. The signals' magnitudes, of the order of 10-4 E, are beyond the resolution of typical exploration instruments. Improvements to Superconducting Gravity Gradiometers are necessary for gravity gradients to be used as a viable method for the observation of the stress field changes over large spatial scales.},

    abstract = {We consider the long-term evolution of debris following the tidal disruption of compact stars in the context of short gamma ray bursts. The initial encounter impulsively creates a hot, dense, neutrino-cooled disk capable of powering the prompt emission. After a long delay, we find that powerful winds are launched from the surface of the disk, driven by the recombination of free nucleons into α-particles. The associated energy release depletes the mass supply and eventually shuts off activity of the central engine. As a result, the luminosity and mass accretion rate deviate from the earlier self-similar behavior expected for an isolated ring with efficient cooling. This then enables a secondary episode of delayed activity to become prominent as an observable signature, when material in the tidal tails produced by the initial encounter returns to the vicinity of the central object. The timescale of the new accretion event can reach tens of seconds to minutes, depending on the details of the system. The associated energies and timescales are consistent with those occurring in X-ray flares.}

    abstract = {The discovery and subsequent study of optical counterparts to transient sources is crucial for their complete astrophysical understanding. Various gamma-ray burst (GRB) detectors, and more notably the ground-based gravitational wave detectors, typically have large uncertainties in the sky positions of detected sources. Searching these large sky regions spanning hundreds of square degrees is a formidable challenge for most ground-based optical telescopes, which can usually image less than tens of square degrees of the sky in a single night. We present algorithms for better scheduling of such follow-up observations in order to maximize the probability of imaging the optical counterpart, based on the all-sky probability distribution of the source position. We incorporate realistic observing constraints such as the diurnal cycle, telescope pointing limitations, available observing time, and the rising/setting of the target at the observatory’s location. We use simulations to demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform the default greedy observing schedule used by many observatories. Our algorithms are applicable for follow-up of other transient sources with large positional uncertainties, such as Fermi -detected GRBs, and can easily be adapted for scheduling radio or space-based X-ray follow-up.}

    abstract = {Besides being among the most promising sources of gravitational waves, merging neutron star binaries also represent a leading scenario to explain the phenomenology of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). Recent observations have revealed a large subclass of SGRBs with roughly constant luminosity in their X-ray afterglows, lasting 10-10 4 s. These features are generally taken as evidence of a long-lived central engine powered by the magnetic spin-down of a uniformly rotating, magnetized object. We propose a different scenario in which the central engine powering the X-ray emission is a differentially rotating hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) that launches a quasi-isotropic and baryon-loaded wind driven by the magnetic field, which is built-up through differential rotation. Our model is supported by long-term, three-dimensional, general-relativistic, and ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations, showing that this isotropic emission is a very robust feature. For a given HMNS, the presence of a collimated component depends sensitively on the initial magnetic field geometry, while the stationary electromagnetic luminosity depends only on the magnetic energy initially stored in the system. We show that our model is compatible with the observed timescales and luminosities and express the latter in terms of a simple scaling relation.}

    abstract = {We study the role of light, neutron-rich nuclei during r -process nucleosynthesis in supernovae. Most previous studies of the r -process have concentrated on the reaction flow of heavy, unstable nuclei. Although the nuclear reaction network includes a few thousand heavy nuclei, only limited reaction flow through light nuclei near the stability line has been used in those studies. However, in a viable scenario of the r -process in neutrino-driven winds, the initial condition is a high-entropy hot plasma consisting of neutrons, protons, and electron-positron pairs experiencing an intense flux of neutrinos. In such environments, light nuclei, as well as heavy nuclei, are expected to play important roles in the production of seed nuclei and r -process elements. Thus, we have extended our fully implicit nuclear reaction network so that it includes all nuclei up to the neutron-drip line for Z ≤ 10, in addition to a larger network for Z ≥ 10. In the present nucleosynthesis study, we utilize a wind model of massive Type II supernova explosions to study the effects of this extended network. We find that a new nuclear reaction flow path opens in the very light, neutron-rich region. This new nuclear reaction flow can change the final heavy-element abundances by as much as an order of magnitude.}

    abstract  = {We describe observed properties of the Type Iax class of supernovae (SNe Iax), consisting of SNe observationally similar to its prototypical member, SN 2002cx. The class currently has 25 members, and we present optical photometry and/or optical spectroscopy for most of them. SNe Iax are spectroscopically similar to SNe Ia, but have lower maximum-light velocities (2000 ≲ |v| ≲ 8000 km s–1), typically lower peak magnitudes (–14.2 ⩾ M

                 V, peak ≳ –18.9 mag), and most have hot photospheres. Relative to SNe Ia, SNe Iax have low luminosities for their light-curve shape. There is a correlation between luminosity and light-curve shape, similar to that of SNe Ia, but offset from that of SNe Ia and with larger scatter. Despite a host-galaxy morphology distribution that is highly skewed to late-type galaxies without any SNe Iax discovered in elliptical galaxies, there are several indications that the progenitor stars are white dwarfs (WDs): evidence of C/O burning in their maximum-light spectra, low (typically ∼0.5 M
                 ☉) ejecta masses, strong Fe lines in their late-time spectra, a lack of X-ray detections, and deep limits on massive stars and star formation at the SN sites. However, two SNe Iax show strong He lines in their spectra. The progenitor system and explosion model that best fits all of the data is a binary system of a C/O WD that accretes matter from a He star and has a deflagration. At least some of the time, this explosion will not disrupt the WD. The small number of SNe in this class prohibit a detailed analysis of the homogeneity and heterogeneity of the entire class. We estimate that in a given volume there are  SNe Iax for every 100 SNe Ia, and for every 1 M
                 ☉ of iron generated by SNe Ia at z = 0, SNe Iax generate ∼0.036 M
                 ☉. Being the largest class of peculiar SNe, thousands of SNe Iax will be discovered by LSST. Future detailed observations of SNe Iax should further our understanding of both their progenitor systems and explosions as well as those of SNe Ia.}

    abstract  = {We report on a pilot study on identifying metal-poor stars pre-enriched by Pair-Instability Supernovae (PISNe). Very massive, first generation (Population III) stars (140 M☉ ≤ M ≤ 260 M☉) end their lives as PISNe, which have been predicted by theories, but no relics of PISNe have been observed yet. Among the distinct characteristics of the yields of PISNe, as predicted by theoretical calculations, are a strong odd-even effect, and a strong overabundance of Ca with respect to iron and the solar ratio. We use the latter characteristic to identify metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo that have been pre-enriched by PISNe, by comparing metallicites derived from strong, co-added Fe lines detected in low-resolution (i.e., R = λ/Δλ ∼ 2000) spectra of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), with metallicities determined by the SDSS Stellar Parameters Pipeline (SSPP). The latter are based on the strength of the Ca II K line and assumptions on the Ca/Fe abundance ratio. Stars are selected as candidates if their metallicity derived from Fe lines is significantly lower than the SSPP metallicities. In a sample of 12 300 stars for which SDSS spectroscopy is available, we have identified 18 candidate stars. Higher resolution and signal-to-noise ratio spectra of these candidates are being obtained with the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory and the XSHOOTER spectrograph, to determine their abundance patterns, and to verify our selection method. We plan to apply our method to the database of several million stellar spectra to be acquired with the Guo Shou Jing Telescope (LAMOST) in the next five years.}

    abstract      = {Computational demands in gravitational-wave astronomy are expected to at least double over the next five years. As kilometre-scale interferometers are brought to design sensitivity, real-time delivery of gravitational-wave alerts will become increasingly important to enable multimessenger follow-up. Here we discuss a novel implementation and deployment of deep learning inference for real-time data denoising and astrophysical source identification. This objective is accomplished using a generic inference-as-a-service model capable of adapting to the future needs of gravitational-wave data analysis. The implementation allows seamless incorporation of hardware accelerators and also enables the use of commercial or private as-a-service computing. Low-latency and offline computing in gravitational-wave astronomy addresses key challenges in scalability and reliability and provides a data analysis platform particularly optimized for deep learning applications.},

It exhibits traditional astronomy broker features such as automatized ingestion, annotation, selection, and redistribution of promising alerts for transient science. It is also designed to go beyond traditional broker features by providing real-time transient classification that is continuously improved by using state-of-the-art deep learning and adaptive learning techniques. These evolving added values will enable more accurate scientific output from LSST photometric data for diverse science cases while also leading to a higher incidence of new discoveries which shall accompany the evolution of the survey. In this paper, we introduce fink, its science motivation, architecture, and current status including first science verification cases using the Zwicky Transient Facility alert stream.}},

    abstract  = {We introduce the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) broker, an astronomical alert broker designed to provide a rapid and self-consistent classification of large etendue telescope alert streams, such as that provided by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and, in the future, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). ALeRCE is a Chilean-led broker run by an interdisciplinary team of astronomers and engineers working to become intermediaries between survey and follow-up facilities. ALeRCE uses a pipeline that includes the real-time ingestion, aggregation, cross-matching, machine-learning (ML) classification, and visualization of the ZTF alert stream. We use two classifiers: a stamp-based classifier, designed for rapid classification, and a light curve–based classifier, which uses the multiband flux evolution to achieve a more refined classification. We describe in detail our pipeline, data products, tools, and services, which are made public for the community (see https://alerce.science). Since we began operating our real-time ML classification of the ZTF alert stream in early 2019, we have grown a large community of active users around the globe. We describe our results to date, including the real-time processing of 1.5 × 108 alerts, the stamp classification of 3.4 × 107 objects, the light-curve classification of 1.1 × 106 objects, the report of 6162 supernova candidates, and different experiments using LSST-like alert streams. Finally, we discuss the challenges ahead in going from a single stream of alerts such as ZTF to a multistream ecosystem dominated by LSST.}

    abstract   = {{We present our follow-up observations with GRANDMA of transient sources revealed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Over a period of six months, all ZTF alerts were examined in real time by a dedicated science module implemented in the Fink broker, which will be used in filtering of transients discovered by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. In this article, we present three selection methods to identify kilonova candidates. Out of more than 35 million alerts, a hundred sources have passed our selection criteria. Six were then followed-up by GRANDMA (by both professional and amateur astronomers). The majority were finally classified either as asteroids or as supernovae events. We mobilized 37 telescopes, bringing together a large sample of images, taken under various conditions and quality. To complement the orphan kilonova candidates, we included three additional supernovae alerts to conduct further observations during summer 2021. We demonstrate the importance of the amateur astronomer community that contributed images for scientific analyses of new sources discovered in a magnitude range r′ = 17 − 19 mag. We based our rapid kilonova classification on the decay rate of the optical source that should exceed 0.3 mag d−1. GRANDMA's follow-up determined the fading rate within 1.5 $\pm$ 1.2 d post-discovery, without waiting for further observations from ZTF. No confirmed kilonovae were discovered during our observing campaign. This work will be continued in the coming months in the view of preparing for kilonova searches in the next gravitational-wave observing run O4.}},

    abstract  = {The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggers on-board in response to ∼40 short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) per year; however, their large localization regions have made the search for optical counterparts a challenging endeavour. We have developed and executed an extensive program with the wide field of view of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera, mounted on the Palomar 48 inch Oschin telescope (P48), to perform target-of-opportunity (ToO) observations on 10 Fermi-GBM SGRBs during 2018 and 2020–2021. Bridging the large sky areas with small field-of-view optical telescopes in order to track the evolution of potential candidates, we look for the elusive SGRB afterglows and kilonovae (KNe) associated with these high-energy events. No counterpart has yet been found, even though more than 10 ground-based telescopes, part of the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) network, have taken part in these efforts. The candidate selection procedure and the follow-up strategy have shown that ZTF is an efficient instrument for searching for poorly localized SGRBs, retrieving a reasonable number of candidates to follow up and showing promising capabilities as the community approaches the multi-messenger era. Based on the median limiting magnitude of ZTF, our searches would have been able to retrieve a GW170817-like event up to ∼200  Mpc and SGRB afterglows to z = 0.16 or 0.4, depending on the assumed underlying energy model. Future ToOs will expand the horizon to z = 0.2 and 0.7, respectively.}

Previous research efforts have not sufficiently explored students perceptions around the commitment and adequacy of effort spent on software engineering projects, their project performance and skills that are developed during course projects. This gap in skills awareness includes those that are necessary, anticipated and learned, and the challenges to student project success, which may predict project performance. Such insights could inform curricula design, theory and practice, in terms of improving post-study software development success. We conducted a survey involving undergraduate across four universities in New Zealand and Cyprus to explore these issues, where extensive deductive and inductive analyses were performed. Among our findings we observe that students’ commitment of effort on software engineering project seems appropriate. Students are more satisfied with their team’s collaboration performance than technical contributions, but we found that junior students seemed to struggle with teamwork. Further, we observe that the software students developed were of higher quality if they had worked in project teams previously, had stronger technical skills and were involved in timely meetings. This study singles out mechanisms for informing good estimation of effort, mentoring technical competencies and suitable coaching for enhancing project success and student learning.}

    abstract  = {We present very early, high-cadence photometric observations of the nearby Type Ia SN 2017cbv. The light curve is unique in that it has a blue bump during the first five days of observations in the U, B, and g bands, which is clearly resolved given our photometric cadence of 5.7 hr during that time span. We model the light curve as the combination of early shocking of the supernova ejecta against a nondegenerate companion star plus a standard SN Ia component. Our best-fit model suggests the presence of a subgiant star 56 R☉ from the exploding white dwarf, although this number is highly model-dependent. While this model matches the optical light curve well, it overpredicts the observed flux in the ultraviolet bands. This may indicate that the shock is not a blackbody, perhaps because of line blanketing in the UV. Alternatively, it could point to another physical explanation for the optical blue bump, such as interaction with circumstellar material or an unusual nickel distribution. Early optical spectra of SN 2017cbv show strong carbon (C ii λ6580) absorption up through day −13 with respect to maximum light, suggesting that the progenitor system contains a significant amount of unburned material. These early results on SN 2017cbv illustrate the power of early discovery and intense follow-up of nearby supernovae to resolve standing questions about the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms of SNe Ia.}

    abstract  = {Early observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide essential clues for understanding the progenitor system that gave rise to the terminal thermonuclear explosion. We present exquisite observations of SN 2019yvq, the second observed SN Ia, after iPTF 14atg, to display an early flash of emission in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical. Our analysis finds that SN 2019yvq was unusual, even when ignoring the initial flash, in that it was moderately underluminous for an SN Ia ( mag at peak) yet featured very high absorption velocities ( km s−1 for Si ii λ6355 at peak). We find that many of the observational features of SN 2019yvq, aside from the flash, can be explained if the explosive yield of radioactive 56Ni is relatively low (we measure ) and it and other iron-group elements are concentrated in the innermost layers of the ejecta. To explain both the UV/optical flash and peak properties of SN 2019yvq we consider four different models: interaction between the SN ejecta and a nondegenerate companion, extended clumps of 56Ni in the outer ejecta, a double-detonation explosion, and the violent merger of two white dwarfs. Each of these models has shortcomings when compared to the observations; it is clear additional tuning is required to better match SN 2019yvq. In closing, we predict that the nebular spectra of SN 2019yvq will feature either H or He emission, if the ejecta collided with a companion, strong [Ca ii] emission, if it was a double detonation, or narrow [O i] emission, if it was due to a violent merger.}

    abstract  = {The progenitors of Type Ia and some core collapse supernovae are thought to be stars in binary systems, but little direct observational evidence exists to confirm the hypothesis. We show that the collision of the supernova ejecta with its companion star should produce detectable emission in the hours and days following the explosion. The interaction occurs at distances ∼1011–1013 cm and shocks the impacting supernova debris, dissipating kinetic energy and re-heating the gas. Initially, some radiation may escape promptly through the evacuated region of the shadowcone, producing a bright X-ray (0.1–2 keV) burst lasting minutes to hours with luminosity L ∼ 1044 ergs s−1. Continuing radiative diffusion from deeper layers of shock-heated ejecta produces a longer lasting optical/UV emission, which exceeds the radioactively powered luminosity of the supernova for the first few days after the explosion. These signatures are prominent for viewing angles looking down upon the shocked region, or about 10% of the time. The properties of the emission provide a straightforward measure of the separation distance between the stars and hence (assuming Roche lobe overflow) the companion's radius. Current optical and UV data sets likely already constrain red giant companions. By systematically acquiring early time data for many supernovae, it may eventually be possible to empirically determine how the parameters of the progenitor system influence the outcome of the explosion.}

                 18 days of the unusual transient event, ATLAS18qqn/AT2018cow.
                 It is characterized by a high peak luminosity
                 (∼1.7 × 1044 erg s−1), rapidly evolving light curves
                 (>5 mag rise to peak in ∼3.5 days), and hot blackbody spectra,
                 peaking at ∼27,000 K that are relatively featureless and unchanging
                 over the first two weeks. The bolometric light curve cannot be powered
                 by radioactive decay under realistic assumptions. The detection of
                 high-energy emission may suggest a central engine as the powering source.
                 Using a magnetar model, we estimated an ejected mass of 0.1–0.4 M,
                 which lies between that of low-energy core-collapse events and the
                 kilonova, AT2017gfo. The spectra cooled rapidly from 27,000 to
                 15,000 K in just over two weeks but remained smooth and featureless.
                 Broad and shallow emission lines appear after about 20 days, and
                 we tentatively identify them as He i although they would be redshifted
                 from their rest wavelengths. We rule out that there are any features
                 in the spectra due to intermediate mass elements up to and including the
                 Fe group. The presence of r-process elements cannot be ruled out.
                 If these lines are due to He, then we suggest a low-mass star with
                 residual He as a potential progenitor. Alternatively, models of magnetars
                 formed in neutron star mergers, or accretion onto a central compact object,
                 give plausible matches to the data.}

The host galaxy is a dwarf starburst galaxy (, ) that is moderately metal-enriched (), similar to the hosts of GRBs and superluminous supernovae. As in AT2018cow, the radio and optical emission in ZTF18abvkwla likely arise from two separate components: the radio from fast-moving ejecta () and the optical from shock-interaction with confined dense material (<0.07 M⊙ in ). Compiling transients in the literature with and mag, we find that a significant number are engine-powered, and suggest that the high peak optical luminosity is directly related to the presence of this engine. From 18 months of the 1DC survey, we find that transients in this rise-luminosity phase space are at least two to three orders of magnitude less common than CC SNe. Finally, we discuss strategies for identifying such events with future facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, as well as prospects for detecting accompanying X-ray and radio emission.}

    journal   = {The Astrophysical Journal},
    abstract  = {We present X-ray and radio observations of the Fast Blue Optical Transient CRTS-CSS161010 J045834−081803 (CSS161010 hereafter) at t = 69–531 days. CSS161010 shows luminous X-ray (Lx ∼ 5 × 1039 erg s−1) and radio (Lν ∼ 1029 erg s−1 Hz−1) emission. The radio emission peaked at ∼100 days post-transient explosion and rapidly decayed. We interpret these observations in the context of synchrotron emission from an expanding blast wave. CSS161010 launched a mildly relativistic outflow with velocity Γβc ≥ 0.55c at ∼100 days. This is faster than the non-relativistic AT 2018cow (Γβc ∼ 0.1c) and closer to ZTF18abvkwla (Γβc ≥ 0.3c at 63 days). The inferred initial kinetic energy of CSS161010 (Ek ≳ 1051 erg) is comparable to that of long gamma-ray bursts, but the ejecta mass that is coupled to the mildly relativistic outflow is significantly larger (). This is consistent with the lack of observed γ-rays. The luminous X-rays were produced by a different emission component to the synchrotron radio emission. CSS161010 is located at ∼150 Mpc in a dwarf galaxy with stellar mass M* ∼ 107 M⊙ and specific star formation rate sSFR ∼ 0.3 Gyr−1. This mass is among the lowest inferred for host galaxies of explosive transients from massive stars. Our observations of CSS161010 are consistent with an engine-driven aspherical explosion from a rare evolutionary path of a H-rich stellar progenitor, but we cannot rule out a stellar tidal disruption event on a centrally located intermediate-mass black hole. Regardless of the physical mechanism, CSS161010 establishes the existence of a new class of rare (rate < 0.4% of the local core-collapse supernova rate) H-rich transients that can launch mildly relativistic outflows.}

    journal   = {The Astrophysical Journal},
    abstract  = {We present detailed observations of ZTF18abukavn (SN2018gep), discovered in high-cadence data from the Zwicky Transient Facility as a rapidly rising (1.4 ± 0.1 mag hr−1) and luminous ( mag) transient. It is spectroscopically classified as a broad-lined stripped-envelope supernova (Ic-BL SN). The high peak luminosity (), the short rise time ( in g band), and the blue colors at peak () all resemble the high-redshift Ic-BL iPTF16asu, as well as several other unclassified fast transients. The early discovery of SN2018gep (within an hour of shock breakout) enabled an intensive spectroscopic campaign, including the highest-temperature () spectra of a stripped-envelope SN. A retrospective search revealed luminous ( mag) emission in the days to weeks before explosion, the first definitive detection of precursor emission for a Ic-BL. We find a limit on the isotropic gamma-ray energy release , a limit on X-ray emission , and a limit on radio emission . Taken together, we find that the early () data are best explained by shock breakout in a massive shell of dense circumstellar material (0.02 ) at large radii () that was ejected in eruptive pre-explosion mass-loss episodes. The late-time () light curve requires an additional energy source, which could be the radioactive decay of Ni-56.}

    abstract  = {SkyPortal is an open-source software package designed to discover interesting transients efficiently, manage follow-up, perform characterization, and visualize the results. By enabling fast access to archival and catalog data, crossmatching heterogeneous data streams, and the triggering and monitoring of on-demand observations for further characterization, a SkyPortal-based platform has been operating at scale for \&gt;2 yr for the Zwicky Transient Facility Phase II community, with hundreds of users, containing tens of millions of time-domain sources, interacting with dozens of telescopes, and enabling community reporting. While SkyPortal emphasizes rich user experiences across common front-end workflows, recognizing that scientific inquiry is increasingly performed programmatically, SkyPortal also surfaces an extensive and well-documented application programming interface system. From back-end and front-end software to data science analysis tools and visualization frameworks, the SkyPortal design emphasizes the reuse and leveraging of best-in-class approaches, with a strong extensibility ethos. For instance, SkyPortal now leverages ChatGPT large language models to generate and surface source-level human-readable summaries automatically. With the imminent restart of the next generation of gravitational-wave detectors, SkyPortal now also includes dedicated multimessenger features addressing the requirements of rapid multimessenger follow-up: multitelescope management, team/group organizing interfaces, and crossmatching of multimessenger data streams with time-domain optical surveys, with interfaces sufficiently intuitive for newcomers to the field. This paper focuses on the detailed implementations, capabilities, and early science results that establish SkyPortal as a community software package ready to take on the data science challenges and opportunities presented by this next chapter in the multimessenger era.}

    abstract  = {We introduce the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) Local Volume Sample (NED-LVS), a subset of ∼1.9 million objects with distances out to 1000 Mpc. We use UV and IR fluxes available in NED from all-sky surveys to derive physical properties, and estimate the completeness relative to the expected local luminosity density. The completeness relative to near-IR luminosities (which traces a galaxy’s stellar mass) is roughly 100% at D &lt; 30 Mpc and remains moderate (70%) out to 300 Mpc. For brighter galaxies (≳L *), NED-LVS is ∼100% complete out to ∼400 Mpc. When compared to other local Universe samples (GLADE and HECATE), all three are ∼100% complete below 30 Mpc. At distances beyond ∼80 Mpc, NED-LVS is more complete than both GLADE and HECATE by ∼10%–20%. NED-LVS is the underlying sample for the NED gravitational-wave follow-up service (NED-GWF), which provides prioritized lists of host candidates for GW events within minutes of alerts issued by the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA collaboration. We test the prioritization of galaxies in the volume of GW170817 by three physical properties, where we find that both stellar mass and inverse specific star formation rate place the correct host galaxy in the top 10. In addition, NED-LVS can be used for a wide variety of other astrophysical studies: galaxy evolution, star formation, large-scale structure, galaxy environments, and more. The data in NED are updated regularly, and NED-LVS will be updated concurrently. Consequently, NED-LVS will continue to provide an increasingly complete sample of galaxies for a multitude of astrophysical research areas for years to come.}
